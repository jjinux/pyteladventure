				 PyTeladventure
				 ==============

This is an interactive, phone-based, adventure game.  It's written in Python
using Flask and Twilio.

It's based on https://github.com/jjinux/teladventure which is the same
application, written in Ruby on Rails.

I have started the port but not finished it.  Some of the tests are passing,
but there is still a lot of stuff to finish off.

Phone number: None yet.
Running websites: None yet.
Source code: None yet.

Installation
============

Assuming you're using Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

Execute the rest of this as your normal user from within this directory:

    $ rm -rf env
    $ virtualenv env
    $ bash  # If you're not already in Bash.
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ pip install Flask==0.6.1
    $ pip install lettuce==0.1.21
    $ pip install nose==1.0.0
    $ pip install lxml==2.3

Running
=======

Setup the virtualenv environment:

    $ bash  # If you're not already running Bash.
    $ . env/bin/activate

If you haven't already setup the schema, do so by running the following in a
Python shell (make sure you already setup virtualenv):

    $ python
    >>> from pyteladventure import init_db
    >>> init_db()

Now, start the server:

    $ python runserver.py

Running Tests
=============

Setup the virtualenv environment and then run:

    $ lettuce
